# Employee Directory

## Value add proposal

App allows user to view the info for a group of employees (currently it is actually using mock data form the RandomUser API). In completed state users can also narrow who they view via the search bar or sort employees based on the info fields of the display table.

## Tech stack

Application demonstrates the ability to use React, as well as using Axios to pull data from an external API.


## MVP

### Phase 1

Data is pulled from the RandomUser API to be stored as an array/object. This data is then to be rendered to a table on the frontend via react.


### Phase 2

Search bar allows displayed results to be narrowed according to user text input.


### Phase 3

Table headers can be clicked in order to sort displayed employees according to the clicked table field.
